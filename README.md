# Newitt (Reddit Client Project)

This is my minimalist reddit client called Newitt based on the mockup and project from roadmap.sh. This browser-based reddit client loads the newest content from
a predefined group of subreddits or individually selected subreddits into individual, responsive and dynamic lanes.

Live demo coming soon!

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS, reddit API, Google Fonts (Doto), HeroIcons

This project was created in React, set up through vite. It uses TailwindCSS, Google Fonts (doto), and HeroIcons (trash bin), for styling. Content is fetched directly 
from the reddit API.
